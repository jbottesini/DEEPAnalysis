\title{Splits Participant Data into Hierarchical Bayes inputs}
\usage{
deepSplit(raw_data, DEEPtype)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_data}{dataframe containing DEEP risk/time output}

\item{DEEPtype}{character string that specifies whether output is DEEP "risk" or "time".}
}
\value{
Writes four CSV files named according to what DEEP type was specified.
}
\description{
\code{deepSplit} subsets the "transformed" Limesurvey or Qualtrics DEEP output, after it has been loaded
to a dataframe, and exports four CSV files into the current working directory that will be read by the Hierarchical Bayes. In addition, it creates a CSV containing the time (in seconds) that each participant spent on each question.
Note: Correct specification of the DEEP type is required for proper naming of files.
